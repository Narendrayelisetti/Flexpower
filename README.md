In the file name task1,task2.py i have written solution for 1 and 2 tasks to excute in your system please change the path of sqlite file.

docker build -t app .       ------this comand to build docker image 





docker run -p 8080:8080 app               ----------this to run the docker image...note please leave space after name app and then hit enter.offcourse if some other docker is running plese modify port number
